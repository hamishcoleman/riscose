How to allow templates to be built, being careful not to clobber
existing filled-in ones

What happens if we change the riscose_template output and then want
to re-integrate things written using the old template?

Need a OS_CLI to run UnixLib-based software (remember that you can use
-mlibscl to get working binaries, though).  How should this be done?
Probably a similar registration system for handlers as for SWIs

Do we want to put all code into swi emulation files, or generally have
a more flexible approach that allows separate source files?

Would be nice if e.g. libfileswitch.a was merged with libos.a rather
than having to put libfileswitch.a in the main src/Makefile.am

Some SWIs in wimp have different OSLib routines for the same SWI.
Either:
	patch the .osl file to leave only one routine
	make the above automatic in defmod
	leave them in there and write the despatcher to call one
	particular version
