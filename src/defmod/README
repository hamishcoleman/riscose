defmod is part of the OSLib project, although riscose's version has
deviated from it.  It reads a .osl file defining part of the RISC OS API
and produces one of three outputs depending on its command line options.

An OS API .h file contains #defines, typedefs, etc.  It also has the
function prototypes of the functions that are hand-written to implement
the SWIs.

An OS API .c file #includes the OS API .h file and contains the
hand-written functions prototyped in the .h file.  The functions are
called by...

The SWI marshalling functions in the osapi directory.  These un-marshal
and marshal parameters from the ARM emulator's registers and call the
hand-written functions to do the work.

The OS API .c files, although hand-written, can initially be generated
with stubs by defmod.
