# If your SWI emulations need to pass back error blocks to the caller,
# write them into this file in this format, one per line:
#
#   <symbolic name> <hex error number> <message>
#
# Then in your SWI emulation, #include "riscos_errors.h" and then call
# riscos_error(symbolic_name) which returns the ARM address of the error
# block to put into R0
