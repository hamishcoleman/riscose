The *.osl files are from the OSLib distribution.  They're brought here
one by one and added to Makefile.am's libosapi_a_SOURCES definition.

`make' produces a .c and .h for each .osl.  The .c is compiled into a .o
that ends up in libosapi.a.  Since both the .c and .h are automatically
produced, they should *not* be edit by hand.  A `make clean' will remove
them.

The .c registers the SWIs it handles with riscose.  It contains handler
functions for those SWIs with names like `swih_basictrans_help'.  These
un-marshal the SWIs parameters from the emulated ARM's registers, call a
hand-written C routine with a name of the form `xbasictrans_help', and,
if xbasictrans_help didn't return an error, marshal its return values
back into emulated ARM registers.

The .h contains function prototypes for .c's routines along with useful
#defines, typedefs, etc.  The .h is typically #included by the .c and
also by the hand-written .c file containing the actual code to implement
the SWI.
